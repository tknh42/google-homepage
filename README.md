This will be my first project for Web Development 101 on TOP. I will be recreating the google home page and search page utilizing HTML and CSS.

The index.html will contain my html code and the CSS will be in the styles folder.

This will be the first time I do a project with HTML and CSS. I hope that along this journey, I can look back at this note and reflect on how much I have learned.
